# Rmleda

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Rmleda is to build a R package called `Rmleda` with relevant functions to help with preliminary EDA for a given dataset. The package contains functions and classes that help perform various data preparation and wrangling tasks such as data splitting, exploration, imputation, and scaling. These functionalities were identified as commonly-performed tasks in supervised machine learning settings but may provide value in other project types as well.

The `Rmleda` package will include the following classes/functions:

-   `SupervisedData` is a wrapper class that splits a dataframe into train and test sets and further into X and y subsets based on a list of user-provided columns.

-   `dftype()` function will return the type of columns and variables for the input data frame. Furthermore, if there are non-numeric columns, it will return the unique values of non-numeric columns and their length.

-   `autoimpute_na()` function to identify and impute missing values for different attributes in a given dataframe.

-   `dfscaling()` function to apply standard scaling to the numerical features in a dataframe.

The `Rmleda` package is intended to help with EDA for supervised machine learning tasks; there are other existing packages that contain some similar functionality. Our `Rmleda` package intends to augment the existing functionality of these packages with some additional features.

## Installation

You can install the released version of Rmleda from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Rmleda")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/Rmleda")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(Rmleda)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
