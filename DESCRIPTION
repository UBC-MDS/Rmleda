Description: The project aims to build a R package called Rmleda with relevant 
             functions to help with preliminary EDA for a given dataset. The package contains 
             functions and classes that help perform various data preparation and 
             wrangling tasks such as data splitting, exploration, imputation, and scaling. 
             These functionalities were identified as commonly-performed tasks in supervised 
             machine learning settings but may provide value in other project types as well.
